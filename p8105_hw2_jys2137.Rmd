The purpose of this file is to present the answers to Homework 2, an assignment reinforcing ideas in the **Data Wrangling I** topic for P8105. 


## Problem 0.1

This “problem” focuses on structure of my submission, especially the use git and GitHub for reproducibility, R Projects to organize my work, R Markdown to write reproducible reports, relative paths to load data from local files, and reasonable naming structures for my files.

To that end:

* I created a public GitHub repo + local R Project; we suggest naming this repo / directory p8105_hw2_jys2137
* I created a single .Rmd file named p8105_hw2_jys2137.Rmd that renders to github_document
* I created a subdirectory to store the local data files used in this assignment, and used relative paths to access these data files
* I will submit a link to my repo via Courseworks
* I aim to adhere to appropriate styling and clarity of code in Problems 1+.


## Problem 1

### Cleaning the _Mr. Trash Wheel_ sheet

The code chunk below is used to:

- **clean** the `Mr. Trash Wheel` sheet by:
  - omitting non-data entries (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes)
  - using reasonable variable names (clean names)
  - omitting rows that do not include `dumpster`-specific data
- **round** `sports_balls` to the nearest integer

```{r clean_mr_trash_wheel}
mr_trash_wheel_sheet = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(dumpster:homes_powered) %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits = 0))
```

### Cleaning precipitation data for 2018 and 2019

The code chunk below **cleans** the precipitation data for 2018 and 2019 by:

- omitting rows without precipitation data 
- adding a variable for year

```{r clean_precipitation_2018_2019}
precip_2018 = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018)

precip_2019 = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2019 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month, total) %>%
  mutate(year = 2019)
```
