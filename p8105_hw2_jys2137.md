The purpose of this file is to present the answers to Homework 2, an
assignment reinforcing ideas in the **Data Wrangling I** topic for
P8105.

## Problem 0.1

This “problem” focuses on structure of my submission, especially the use
git and GitHub for reproducibility, R Projects to organize my work, R
Markdown to write reproducible reports, relative paths to load data from
local files, and reasonable naming structures for my files.

To that end:

-   I created a public GitHub repo + local R Project; we suggest naming
    this repo / directory p8105\_hw2\_jys2137
-   I created a single .Rmd file named p8105\_hw2\_jys2137.Rmd that
    renders to github\_document
-   I created a subdirectory to store the local data files used in this
    assignment, and used relative paths to access these data files
-   I will submit a link to my repo via Courseworks
-   I aim to adhere to appropriate styling and clarity of code in
    Problems 1+.

## Problem 1

### Cleaning the *Mr. Trash Wheel* sheet

The code chunk below is used to:

-   **clean** the `Mr. Trash Wheel` sheet by:
    -   omitting non-data entries (rows with notes / figures; columns
        containing notes)
    -   using reasonable variable names (clean names)
    -   omitting rows that do not include `dumpster`-specific data
-   **round** `sports_balls` to the nearest integer

``` r
mr_trash_wheel_sheet = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(dumpster:homes_powered) %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits = 0))
```
