The purpose of this file is to present the answers to Homework 2, an
assignment reinforcing ideas in the **Data Wrangling I** topic for
P8105.

## Problem 0.1

This “problem” focuses on structure of my submission, especially the use
git and GitHub for reproducibility, R Projects to organize my work, R
Markdown to write reproducible reports, relative paths to load data from
local files, and reasonable naming structures for my files.

To that end:

-   I created a public GitHub repo + local R Project; we suggest naming
    this repo / directory p8105\_hw2\_jys2137
-   I created a single .Rmd file named p8105\_hw2\_jys2137.Rmd that
    renders to github\_document
-   I created a subdirectory to store the local data files used in this
    assignment, and used relative paths to access these data files
-   I will submit a link to my repo via Courseworks
-   I aim to adhere to appropriate styling and clarity of code in
    Problems 1+.

## Problem 1

### Cleaning the *Mr. Trash Wheel* sheet

The code chunk below is used to:

-   **clean** the `Mr. Trash Wheel` sheet by:
    -   omitting non-data entries (rows with notes / figures; columns
        containing notes)
    -   using reasonable variable names (clean names)
    -   omitting rows that do not include `dumpster`-specific data
-   **round** `sports_balls` to the nearest integer

``` r
mr_trash_wheel_sheet = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(dumpster:homes_powered) %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits = 0))
```

### Cleaning precipitation data for 2018 and 2019

The code chunk below **cleans** the precipitation data for 2018 and 2019
by:

-   omitting rows without precipitation data
-   adding a variable for year

``` r
precip_2018 = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018)

precip_2019 = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2019 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month, total) %>%
  mutate(year = 2019)
```

### Combining precipitation datasets

Next, we **combine** the precipitation datasets and **convert month** to
a character variable. (the variable month.name is built into R and
should be useful).

### Description of the data

##### For the *Mr. Trash Wheel* data

The *Mr. Trash Wheel* dataset includes **344** observations, taking
**14** variables into account. These 14 variables include information on
each `dumpster` (including number, weight, and volume) and the amount of
each litter type (including `plastic_bottles`, `polystyrene`,
`cigarette_butts`, `glass_bottles`, `grocery_bags`, `chip_bags`, and
`sports_balls`). The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017
was **8**.

##### For the *precipitation* data

The precipitation data includes Write a paragraph about these data; you
are encouraged to use inline R. Be sure to note the number of
observations in both resulting datasets, and give examples of key
variables. For available data, what was the total precipitation in 2018?
